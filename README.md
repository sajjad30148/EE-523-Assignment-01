Power Flow on Kudur 11 Bus System

Book: Power System Stability and Control by Prava Kundur

Problem Statement:
Consider Kundur two area system described in Example 12.6 of the book.

a) Model Bus 1 as a slack bus. Model Buses 2, 3 and 4 as PV buses and solve the power-flow using Newton-Raphson and Fast Decoupled algorithms. 
Verify your solutions with the power-flow results given in Example 12.6.

b) Assume there are three lines connecting buses 7 and 8 and two lines connecting buses 8 and 9. 
Assume the capacities of the shunt capacitors have been increased to be 400 MVar each at buses 7 and 9. 
Resolve part a) using Newton-Raphson and Fast decoupled algorithms.

c) For part b), model Buses 2, 3 and 4 as PQ buses assuming the respective injections to match the solutions of part b). 
Resolve the power-flow using Newton-Raphson and Fast Decoupled algorithms.
